=head1 DESCRIPTION

Twiggy is a lightweight and fast HTTP server with unique features such
as:

=over 4

=item PSGI

Can run any PSGI applications. Fully supports I<psgi.nonblocking> and
I<psgi.streaming> interfaces.

=item AnyEvent

This server uses AnyEvent and runs in a non-blocking event loop, so
it's best to run event-driven web applications that runs I/O bound
jobs or delayed responses such as long-poll, WebSocket or streaming
content (server push).

This software used to be called Plack::Server::AnyEvent but was
renamed to Twiggy. See L</NAMING> for details.

=item Fast header parser

Uses XS/C based HTTP header parser for the best performance. (optional,
install the L<HTTP::Parser::XS> module to enable it; see also
L<Plack::HTTPParser> for more information).

=item Lightweight and Fast

The memory required to run twiggy is 6MB and it can serve more than
4500 req/s with a single process on Perl 5.10 with MacBook Pro 13"
late 2009.

=item Superdaemon aware

Supports L<Server::Starter> for hot deploy and
graceful restarts.

To use it, instead of the usual:

    plackup --server Twiggy --port 8111 app.psgi

install L<Server::Starter> and use:

    start_server --port 8111 plackup --server Twiggy app.psgi
